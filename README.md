Objective: Build on the Dino Game introduced in class by adding new features to make the
game more engaging. Implement point tracking, additional obstacles, speed adjustments,
and any extra features to enhance the game experience.

####Instructions
1. Score Tracking:
- Implement a scoring system that increases as the Dino successfully avoids
obstacles.
- Display the score on the game screen, and have it reset if the player loses.
2. Additional Obstacles:
Add at least two new types of obstacles, such as:
- Bird: A moving obstacle that appears at different heights, making the
Dino duck or avoid it.
- Rock: A larger obstacle that is slower but harder to avoid.
- Use CSS and JavaScript to style and animate these obstacles.
3. Speed Increase:
- Make the game progressively harder by increasing the speed as the score
goes up.
- Adjust the speed of obstacles and ground movement for a more challenging experience.
